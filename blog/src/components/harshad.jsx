                Harshad Mehta. Mehta insisted that the ACC stock was undervalued, and it was just the market correcting itself. To support

                plan that resulted in the manipulation of the rise of the Bombay Stock Exchange, the plan was funded with allegedly guaranteed 
                bank receipts which were bank receipts for short-term banking used to bank loans known as “ready forward” transactions that 
                Mehta’s company negotiated.

                that Mehta was collecting fake bank receipts for other banks to pay him money, believing they were lending securities. That money 
                was diverted into stocks that were later sold for a profit after the stock market rally.
